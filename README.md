# STACK
Stack is a single-ended data structure that can be compared to a bucket. It works on the first-in, last-out principle. Data entry and removal occur from the same end. Stack is useful is arithmetic operations with post-fix forms. A menu was devised to push (enter data), pop (remove data) and display all the elements of the stack. The three actions were defined as functions. The push and pop functions checked whether the stack was full and empty respectively.
